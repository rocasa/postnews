Postnews is a small command line utility written in Python that posts usenet
articles onto remote servers. An article must at least contain the headers
"From: ","Newsgroups: ", "Subject: ", a newline and a body. For something
like a cancellation message, it would need "Control: cancel <message-ID>".
